# What is GitArt?

**A Sustainable Knowledge Archive Platform for Art Works**

Welcome to the Jazz Foundation open-source project. 
We're building a sustainable knowledge archive platform for art works, 
creating a comprehensive database that's easily accessible and shareable.

### Projects

The Jazz Foundation is 
an open-source project dedicated to collecting and utilizing information about art works.

Our core feature is the generation and management of art work metadata,
streamlining information access and discovery.

Through open-source development, we're creating a stable and sustainable platform built to last.
<br />

<br />

> To achieve this, we're implementing  [**[ActivityPub]**](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/),<br />
> a decentralized social networking protocol.
>
> for seamless user communication.<br />
> We're also utilizing  [**[IPFS]**](https://ipfs.tech/)  (_InterPlanetary File System_).
>
> a peer-to-peer file sharing system,<br />
> to ensure permanent storage and accessibility of  **metadata**.
>
> While our initial operating policy comes from the project's founder,<br />
> we use a  **WIKI**  to maintain sustainability and incorporate community improvements.

### The Role of AI in Art Creation
<br />

AI technology is reshaping art creation. <br /> 
Our platform will distinguish between AI-generated and human-created art using machine learning algorithms,<br /> 
helping users make informed decisions about each work's value.
<br />
<br />

### The Importance of Human Involvement
<br />

Art creation transcends technical aspects—it requires understanding human values and emotions.<br />
Human involvement is crucial to our platform's development. <br />
Together, we'll make the Jazz Foundation a vital resource for artists, collectors, and art enthusiasts.
<br />
<br />

### Supporting AI-generated Art
<br />

While AI art grows more sophisticated, it still needs human guidance.<br /> 
By supporting AI artists and recognizing their contributions, <br />
we're fostering a more inclusive artistic community. <br />
Join us in shaping this evolution.
<br />
<br />

### Our Commitment to Artistic Values
<br />

The Jazz Foundation believes in treating all art works with respect and dignity. <br />
We uphold high artistic standards and ensure our platform reflects these principles. <br />
Working with artists, collectors, and connoisseurs, we're creating an informative and inspiring platform. <br />
Join us in this journey!
