## What is GitArt?

Jazz Foundation: A Sustainable Knowledge Archive Platform for Art Works

We are pleased to introduce the Jazz Foundation open-source project, 
which aims to provide a sustainable knowledge archive platform for various art works. 
Our goal is to create a comprehensive overview of art works that can be easily accessed and shared by users.

## Projects

The Jazz Foundation is developed as an open-source project with the aim of collecting and utilizing information on art works. 
The primary feature of our project is generating and managing metadata for art works,
making it easier for users to search and access the information.

We believe that by utilizing open-source development, 
we can create a stable and sustainable platform that can be maintained indefinitely. 
To achieve this goal, we are planning to utilize ActivityPub, 
a decentralized social networking protocol, 
to enable seamless communication between users. 
Additionally, we will use IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), 
a peer-to-peer file sharing system, 
to ensure the permanent storage and accessibility of metadata.

#### The Role of AI in Art Creation
In the future, AI technology will play an increasingly important role in the creation of art works. 
The Jazz Foundation aims to address this development by providing a platform that can distinguish between AI-generated art and human-created art.
To achieve this goal, we will utilize machine learning algorithms that analyze the characteristics of AI-generated art and compare them with those of human-created art. 
This will enable users to make informed decisions about the value and significance of each work.

### The Importance of Human Involvement

However, the creation of art works is not just a technical challenge; it also requires a deep understanding of human values and emotions. 
For this reason, we believe that human involvement is essential in the development of our platform.
By working together with users, we can ensure that the Jazz Foundation remains a valuable resource for artists, collectors, and connoisseurs alike. 
We invite you to join us on this exciting journey into the future of art creation!
 
### Supporting AI-generated Art

While AI-generated art is becoming increasingly sophisticated, it still requires human involvement in many areas. 
By supporting the work of AI artists and acknowledging their contributions, we can help to create a more inclusive and diverse artistic community.
We invite you to join us in this effort by participating in our project and contributing your ideas and expertise. 
Together, we can build a brighter future for art creation!

### Our Commitment to Artistic Values

At the Jazz Foundation, we believe that all art works, regardless of their origin, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. 
We are committed to upholding the highest standards of artistic values and ensuring that our platform reflects these principles.
To achieve this goal, we will work closely with artists, collectors, and connoisseurs to create a platform that is both informative and inspiring. 
We invite you to join us on this journey and contribute your expertise and insights along the way!
 
We look forward to working with you and building a brighter future for **art creation!**
